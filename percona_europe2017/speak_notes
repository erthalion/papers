note about usage of jsonb inside infrastructure team
note about why mongodb, mysql at the beginning
note about depth limit

json vs jsonb select - why is jsonb slower?
- because we're not getting into it

note about jsonb as an intermetiate between plain json (json in pg even) and totally normalized data

- bad mysql throughput on select - there is some strange writing io, I haven't figured it out from where it comes
(it looks like a situation with lack of memory that leads to a small swap, but it's not that bad and memory configured).
