add aggregation to convertion section
jsquery is like mysql path features, but more advanced (e.g. type checking, length of array)
mysql search in json values (not in property names)

oracle - full text search

indexing - for all non native data types it's possible, but it will be index on function or something, not a direct indexing

json in DB2 is really a BSON and it's basically mongodb support inside DB2

mssql has many convertion functions mostly because of concern about compatibility

only oracle and mysql have a $, * directly in path (pg has throught jsquery)

mssql propose the same approach to index json keys as mysql
