# FP in Python: it's simpler than you thought

Functional programming is a quite popular paradigm nowadays, but it suffers
from a lot of myths and misunderstandings around it. And one of them is that
functional programming can be applied only in few special languages, which is
wrong. This paradigm is just a language agnostic way of thinking about your
code. We will discuss pros and cons of applying it in case of Python:

* Why do anyone need this at all?
* Since Python is a multi-paradigm language, what it already can provide for FP?
* Third-party libraries for FP in Python
